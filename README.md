# Tractions

### UNI-V3 NFT Collateral
Themis Protocol can easily access the asset prices in UNI-V3 and use them as a basis to provide collateralized lending of corresponding value, and when the user defaults on the loan, the NFT will be executed to withdraw, which can ensure the safety of the Lender's principal. This solution can also provide UNI-V3's market makers with leverage tools and access to the Vault pool.

### Yielding Farming
Themis's NFT collateralization scheme is no longer limited to the liquidity expectations of the inner-loop collateralization and new output token, but provides normal collateralized lending. For the purpose of risk diversification, the risks and returns of each post-collateralization segment are expected. Asset prices for collateralized lending on Themis will be more stable, creating a whole new pool of incentives through Token's incentive and forfeiture rules.

### Risk Management
Themis Protocol adopts a simple risk control model. By evaluating the three elements of asset liquidity, safety, and profitability, risks are dispersed to all aspects of governance to resist systemic risks.
